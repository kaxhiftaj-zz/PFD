The LoginButton is a UI element that wraps functionality available in the LoginManager. When someone clicks on the button, the login is initiated with the permissions set in the LoginManager.

         We aim to create a community that shares our love for food and is honest, responsible in their feedback.   There is a vacuum for our province and its rich food . To ensure that the PFD serves its purpose there are certain rules that we expect our members to follow:
• The app is about your food experiences (be it at home, restaurant, or somewhere else)
• Be honest in your review of a restaurant.
• If you are the owner of a restaurant or a catering business, you can post / promote it ONCE a week. When you post please state that you belong to the management or own the restaurant. Any excessive posts within a week marketing your restaurant will result in deletion.
• HEALTHY CRITICISM is welcome but criticizing a restaurant just for the sake of it is not acceptable and unfair to them.
• And most importantly, please be COURTEOUS and RESPECTFUL towards estaurants. No personal attacks will be tolerated.
We hope that this app will become a healthy platform that will help foodies in connecting with each Resturants and benefiting from our experiences.
